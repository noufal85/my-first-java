### Jackson Bind
Jackson-databind is a Java package that provides a framework for mapping Java objects to and from JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. It is a part of the Jackson JSON processing library, which is widely used for JSON parsing and serialization in Java-based applications.

With Jackson-databind, developers can easily convert Java objects into JSON and vice versa, making it easier to integrate Java applications with other systems that use JSON for data interchange. This package uses annotations to define the mapping between Java objects and JSON elements, allowing developers to customize the serialization and deserialization process as needed.

Jackson-databind also provides support for handling JSON with polymorphic type information, allowing developers to serialize and deserialize objects with different structures and types in a flexible and extensible way.

Overall, Jackson-databind is a powerful tool for working with JSON data in Java applications and is widely used in enterprise-level systems and open-source projects.

### OutputStreamWriter

The OutputStreamWriter class is a character stream bridge that converts characters written to its output stream into bytes using a specified character encoding. It is commonly used in Java programs to write character data to output streams, such as writing text to a file or sending data over a network.

By importing the OutputStreamWriter class using the import statement, the programmer is able to use the class in their Java program without having to reference its full package name each time it is used. For example, instead of writing "java.io.OutputStreamWriter" each time they want to use the class, they can simply write "OutputStreamWriter".
